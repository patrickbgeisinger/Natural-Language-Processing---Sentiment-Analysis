    "This dataset is a list of over 28,000 consumer reviews for Amazon products like the Kindle, Fire TV Stick, and more from Datafiniti's Product Database updated between February 2019 and April 2019. Each product listing includes the name Amazon in the Brand and Manufacturer field. All fields within this dataset have been flattened, with some omitted, to streamline your data analysis. This version is a sample of a large dataset. The full dataset is available through Datafiniti.\n",
